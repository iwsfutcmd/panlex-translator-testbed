This is a testbed for trying out different ideas for interfaces for the PanLex Database. If I make something neat here, it might end up getting pushed to the official PanLex Translator web interface.

Nothing here is expected to be stable, but if for some reason you want to see what I'm currently tinkering with, clone and run `yarn` to get the dependencies, then `yarn start` to start the server on your machine.

PS if you love PanLex go donate to it. https://www.panlex.org/donate
